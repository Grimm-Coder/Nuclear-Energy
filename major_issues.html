<h3>
Waste Management

Currently, a major problem exists with nuclear reactors: they create harmful radioactive waste that has no permanent solution for it to safely decay. The methods commonly used by companies today are temporary and expensive, and usually take large amounts of space to store. This waste also causes a variety of very serious health problems, from a minor case of radiation poisoning to death. Finally, since it takes so long in order for radiation levels to descend to safe levels, these temporary storage containers will simply pile up. There is a need for a permanent and space efficient fix to storing the harmful waste, and must be viable and usable by major companies.

Accidents

A second major problem with nuclear energy production is the probability of major accidents. Unfortunately, the strict safety protocols in place around nuclear reactors is not enough to prevent all accidents. The problem could range from outdated machinery, to a hardware malfunction, and simply outdated machinery. Some are very minor accidents, with little to no injuries, but some can cause disaster. An INES can be given to any mishap had in nuclear reactors, and is on a scale of one to seven. Fukushima had an INES level five, Chernobyl a level seven, and Kyshtym a level six. Explicit and finely detailed safety procedures can’t possibly prevent every single disaster, so a new, more modern solution must become apparent to avoid them.
