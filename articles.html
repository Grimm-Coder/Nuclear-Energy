Nuclear energy, being such a new method of energy production, is being constantly debated about if it’s worth all of the trouble to produce large amounts of energy. On one side, people say that the safety risks imposed by running these reactors far outway the benefits. They reference some of the major accidents that nuclear reactors had wrought, such as Chernobyl, and that sticking with current renewable energy techniques is the way to a greener future. They also say that the waste produced by these reactors is too dangerous to ever be stored properly, and worry about the health problems that they would cause. On the other hand, people are pushing for more reactors, saying that it is the future of energy production. They say that building a single reactor would produce less emissions than if enough solar panels and wind turbines would have to be made to produce the same amount of energy. It would also produce much more jobs than any other conventional energy method. As for waste management and accidents, science has progressed to a point where a reactor can be made to automatically cool itself when overheating, and produce much less waste than older models of reactors. Currently, nuclear energy produces many mixed feelings, and until it becomes a subject more well known about, it will continue to rise debates until that day.

CBC News: Lake Huron Nuclear Waste Plan Passes Environmental Assessment
</h3>

A deep, geological repository has been proposed to be opened at the Bruce reactor near Lake Huron, and is pending approval by the Environmental Minister. A report sent with the proposal says that storing the waste so close to a freshwater source should not be a concern, as long as the waste is monitored closely. The reports show a suitable setting for a repository near the site, and plan only to bury their low and intermediate level waste there, as high level waste would require different methods of containment that the proposed DGR would not meet. While many are still not convinced, they hope the approval of their plans will sway the opinions of the people.
