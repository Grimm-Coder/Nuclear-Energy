<h2>
Pros and Cons
</h2>

<h3>
Pros
</h3>

<ol type="1">
<li>Low Pollution<br />Nuclear fission produces very low emission, since the reaction is atomical, converting all of the energy produced into heat, not storing it into carbon. The machinery is mostly ran off of the energy produced, and only the backup coolant pump generator uses fossil fuels. Plus, the emissions made are not methane or CO2, which are considered the main greenhouse gasses.</li>
<li>Low Cost to Operate<br />The fission that occurs in uranium happens completely naturally, requiring no human interference apart from regulating the temperatures in the core, coolant levels, machinery, and fixing anything that breaks. Plus, nuclear reactors technology stays relevant for years, and is able to be upgraded easily, significantly increasing the lifetime.
</li>
<li>Reliable<br />With our current usage of uranium, naturally found sources that are accessible by current mining techniques should last us for the next twenty to eighty years. Nuclear fission also doesn’t require favourable weather, and the sources found in the ocean and the Plutonium-239 created should allow our supplies to last longer.</li>
<li>Renewable(To an Extent)<br />With breeding reactors, U-238, a common by-product by enriching U-235 and found in spent rods, can produce Plutonium-239, creating a much larger supply of usable fuel for nuclear reactors. Plus, once we begin to understand nuclear fusion, pretty much the opposite of nuclear fission and powers the sun, we would have nearly infinite power.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Cons
</h3>

<ol type="1">
<li>Impact on Environment<br />The refinement process for uranium isn’t the cleanest, and releases harmful gasses into the environment.</li>
<li>Radioactive Waste<br />This is an unavoidable byproduct of nuclear energy. Once spent, uranium is very radioactive and dangerous. It takes many years to cool and decay, and most of it is stored in temporary solutions.</li>
<li>Accidents<br />Unfortunately, accidents happen. Much of them are small and are easily dealt with, but some are catastrophic failures, resulting in catastrophic events that affect the environment and population around the reactor.</li>
<li>High Initial Cost<br />Building reactors are time consuming and cost lots of money since the technology is fairly new, therefore not cost effective. This also applies to the current waste management, since temporary solutions are also under developed, since research is more focused on long-term options for radioactive waste.</li>
