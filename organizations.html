CNL is the leading Canadian company of nuclear energy innovation. Their research ranges from safely handling medium-grade nuclear waste to efficient ways to transfer heat to the coolant. Most of the company's effort is focused in increasing the safety of the workplace and the waste created, and is the world leader in this field. A major experiment that CNL is currently working on is the Near Surface Disposal Facility, which is for the disposal of medium and low level nuclear waste. This is a permanent storage solution in which impermeable material lines the pit and allows decay can occur on the surface. Surprisingly, this solution does not damage the surrounding environment and allows an affordable long-term solution for companies to use. Canadian Nuclear Laboratories is the leader in Canada and the world that researches the safe use of nuclear reactors and permanent yet affordable storage options for the long term storage of nuclear waste.

Cameco is based almost exclusively on the mining and refining of uranium ore. They own several mines in northern Saskatchewan and contribute almost eighteen percent of the total refined uranium in the world. Cameco also has a few mines in the USA and in Europe and Australia. While Cameco does not do any research about nuclear energy, it wishes to bring clean and affordable nuclear energy to the world in order to make it a more popular energy solution. With Cameco controlling the largest percentage of uranium extracted, they will hopefully succeed their goal, and help provide electricity and jobs to countries around the world.
