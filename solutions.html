Science has produced a viable resolution to the nuclear waste problem. Scientists have proposed deep  geological repositories drilled approximately 500 meters into the ground to place all high-level waste produced by nuclear reactors. This large distance underground makes sure that no radiation will reach the surface, and that future human excavations won’t disturb the decaying process. It would be drilled into a stable geological structure, such as clay or granite, in order to make sure no tectonic movements can disturb the waste. The waste would then be covered in some sort of impermeable material, such as glass, and then again with another material, such as clay. It would be then placed in the hole, then covered in order to make use of the space again once filled. This technology is only now become an affordable solution, and while it requires a deposit nearby of some sort of hard material, companies will soon be able to store all of their waste in a safe place.

Before, the machinery was too complex to be operated by anything but a human being, but scientific advancements has now made automation a way to control all the functions of a nuclear reactor. Robots, advanced programs, AI, and other new technologies would seriously benefit old and new reactors. A network would allow communication amongst all components, enabling components to take the correct action when a problem is found in one component that     may affect the other. While not completely annihilating dangerous situations, it would certainly help reduce the severity of them and help prevent many injuries and deaths.
