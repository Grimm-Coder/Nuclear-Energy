Summary
</h2>

<p>
Nuclear energy is becoming an increasingly popular type of energy generation. Using the natural process of fission that uranium undergoes, the heat generated heats steam which drives a turbine. These facilities come with many desirable and undesirable traits that make it a subject debated about much around the world. Some of these issues stand out, and are constantly brought up in arguments against nuclear energy. Many are worried about major accidents, like Fukushima or Chernobyl, that may happen if reactors were used. While these were caused by unlikely circumstances, smaller accidents could still occur, causing harm to the environment, the employees and economy. Others are more worried about the dangerously radioactive waste made by the generator, and the lack of a place to put it. Much of our current solutions are unsustainable and obtrusive, leaving the waste in storage large storage containers that require lots of space. Reactors in Southern Ontario are facing this problem, having large lots full of concrete silos full of radioactive waste. Advances in technology are helping reduce these threats in any way they can. Scientist have suggested deep geological tunnels lined with impermeable material that stores the highly radioactive waste deep underground. This stores the waste off of the surface and only after millions of erosion will it be revealed, which by then the uranium would have degraded to a point where it’s safe. Better technology is also allowing automation to occur in reactors, new and old, in order to reduce human error caused accidents and to take the proper action against one. With the temptations of enormous energy for humankind through nuclear fission, and the rapid incline of reactors everywhere, these major issues must be addressed for the safe use of nuclear energy.
