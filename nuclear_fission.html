<h2>
Nuclear Fission - What Makes Nuclear Reactors Run
</h2>

Nuclear fission is how nuclear reactors actually work. This is when a neutron is flung into an atom, instantly destabilizing and splitting it into two, releasing a massive amount of energy. Uranium naturally undergoes fission, very slowly, for many years. Nuclear reactors aim to speed up this reaction, drastically shortening the lifespan of this mineral and increasing the radioactivity. An isotope of uranium called U-235 is the perfect candidate for power generation, due to a high energy, but fairly low radiation compared to other variants of uranium. Another candidate for nuclear power generation is Plutonium-239, which is formed when U-238, a common isotope found in U-235, absorbs a neutron during nuclear fission. Plutonium-239 can then be used  to enrich U-235 or as an actual fuel for reactors. Both generate plenty of heat when nuclear fission is induced, heating a coolant to extreme temperatures, turning it into steam. This coolant can be water, liquid CO2, sodium or potassium. The chosen coolant will sometimes will run alongside another pipe to heat the water running inside of it, turning it into steam and turning the turbine to create electricity. This allows the reactor core to run at higher temperatures and never allows the irradiated moisture to touch the turbine, extending its lifetime. The irradiated steam, whether it be water or some other coolant, is thoroughly cleansed to remove all radiation, making it safe to use in the process again. Once uranium is spent, it can easily be recycled to enrich other uranium sources, and the leftover metal, usually highly radioactive, are stored in bunkers made of concrete, steel, and lead until a permanent storage solution is found.
