Uranium is one of the heaviest naturally occurring element known to man, with an atomic mass of 238. Uranium can be found in many rocks between 2-4 parts per million (ppm). It can also be found in sea water at around the same ppm. Uranium is usually extracted from deep underground, using the tunneling method of mining, and much of the process is through machines. A multitude of chemical processes and refining wears down the ore to an uranium oxide concentrate, which is usually the way it’s sold because of its fairly low radiation levels and it also allows buyers to enrich it with their own methods. The most commonly used process of enriching uranium is by evaporating it into vapor, then separating impurities from the uranium, such as U-238. U-238 and other impurities are usually heavier than U-235, allowing it to be collected at the bottom of the chamber and for the U-235 to be collected at the top. This boosts the concentration U-235 from 0.7% to 4-5%. This percentile is much more efficient than a higher or lower one. Too low, and not enough energy would be released to turn the coolant into vapor. Too high, and the reactor would quickly run out of coolant and overheat. A much more popular choice is the centrifuge, pumping the vapor into a fastly rotating chamber, collecting the lighter particles of U-235 in the center and pushing the heavier impurities to the outside. This is a much more energy and cost efficient method, and now the main refining method of uranium. After being turned into a gas and enriched, it’s made into uranium dioxide, which is its metallic form, formed into pellets, pushed down rods, and bundled together with other rods to make a fuel rods for the use in nuclear reactors.
