Uranium only has so many atoms of uranium to split, and eventually it must come to a rest. What’s left is a spent fuel rod, and it must be disposed of. Spent urainium is considered high level waste, the most radioactive waste produced by the nuclear reactors. Most of the waste is the split halves of the U-235, emitting lot’s of radiation, and are encapsulated by the U-238 it’s mixed with. It contributes to almost all of the waste created, at approximately 94%. This must be buried for millions of years before it reaches safe levels of radiation, and 4.5 billion years for it to be completely decayed. Not all of the radiation is contributed by the remains of U-235. Plutonium-239, or Pu-239, is created when U-238 undergoes spontaneous fission, which is exactly what it sounds like. It releases three neutrons that are absorbed by the surrounding atoms, creating U-239. This isotope decays very rapidly, and changes one of it’s neutrons into an electron, creating Neptunium-239. This also decays in a similar way, changing one of its neutrons into an electron, which creates Pu-239, which is stable, but emits lots of radiation. This accounts for only 1% of the waste product, since spontaneous fission is very rare in U-238, and can also be extracted for other uses. The remaining 5% is created minerals from the split U-235 atoms. They become entirely new materials, and are often extracted for research or for their useful properties. The remaining waste inside the fuel rod is then cooled in large pools where they are carefully regulated. After being reduced to safe temperatures, they are traditionally stored in large concrete blocks, no matter the shape or appearance, and enforced with thick lead or steel plating, then stacked or stored in large lots.
